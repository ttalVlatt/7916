---

- The final project for this class is to create a truly "reproducible report" on a topic of your choosing related to higher education
  - The topic can really be almost anything of interest related to higher ed, so long as you can find public data to use
- Your report should be 3-5 pages *including* multiple graphs and visual elements (i.e., not too much text). Your goal is something like what you might hand a senior administrator at your university to summarize a trend/issue/topic
  - You will likely only have a handful of citations
  - You should devote around half your page space to data visualizations and tables
- The primary focus of this report is reproducibility
  - Your data must be publicly available with no IRB restrictions, as you will not submit it. Instead either;
    - Your data will be downloaded automatically as part of your report rendering process (ideal)
    - You will provide clear step by step instructions for me to
      1. Go and download your data
      2. Save it so that I can replicate your report
- All you will submit is a .qmd file and some accompanying .R scripts (as needed if `source()`-ed). The final report document (either .docx or .pdf) will be generated by me as part of the grading process.

# Proposal (5 points)

This assignment should be submitted as a text entry directly on Canvas consisting of;

1. A paragraph describing your project: 
   - What will you be predicting?
   - Why is it interesting?
2. A description of where you will find this data.
3. A few lines describing your dependent variable in detail. What is
   the nature of this outcome as a variable
   
This should be submitted to Canvas by the due date listed.

# Initial Analyses (10 points)

For your initial analyses, I need the following in either a cleanly
formatted R (`.R`) script or Quarto (`.qmd`) file:

1. Code that:
   - Reads in the data set that contains your dependent variable
   - **[If appropriate]** Converts missing values to NA 
   - **[If appropriate]** Reshapes data
   - **[If appropriate]** Joins data
1. **3** of the **4** following plots:
   - A univariate graphic describing the dependent variable (_e.g._
      histogram)
   - The conditional mean of your dependent variable at levels of at
     least one independent variable (_e.g._ box-and-whisker)
   - The distribution of your dependent variable at levels of at least
     one independent variable (_e.g._ grouped density plot, faceted
     density plot)
   - A bivariate graphic that compares your dependent variable with at
     least one other independent variable (_e.g._ scatter plot)
     
This should be submitted to Canvas by the due date listed.

# Draft Report (For Feedback Only)

For your draft report, I need the following in a cleanly formatted
Quarto (`.qmd`) with (if needed) accompanying `.R` scripts that are `source()`-ed as discussed in the [Quarto Lesson](07-quarto-intro.qmd):

1. Well commented code that:
   - Reads in your raw data set
   - Performs all necessary data wrangling tasks to clean, join, and
     reshape your data as necessary for your project
   - Performs all necessary analyses
2. Plots (as necessary, but required) to show the results of your analyses
3. Tables (as necessary, but not required) to show the results of your
   analyses
4. First draft of the written elements of your report; these elements
   should:
   - Motivate your analyses
   - Describe your data
   - Describe your methodological approach, in high-level,
     audience-appropriate manner (think your boss or colleagues, not
     me specifically)
   - Describe your findings
   - Appropriately contextualize your results (_e.g._ limitations,
     validity) and make appropriate recommendations
   - **[As necessary]** Include citations
   - Be well organized

If your data is not automatically downloaded as part of your project, I also need clear step by step instructions (provided as Canvas text entry) for me to
      1. Go and download your data
      2. Save it so that I can replicate your report

# Presentation (5 Points)

- You will present the results of your report in class during the penultimate week of the semester (see date in Canvas)
- The presentation format is up to you, previous students have simply presented an image of one intricate figure they created, others have created a short PowerPoint presentation, others have created presentations using Quarto/RMarkdown/LaTeX. It's up to you!
- The primary rule for this presentation is that it is to be **3-5 mins long** (read min 3 mins, max 5 mins, ideal 4 mins)
  - As this is meant to replicate the you presenting your report to senior administrators, this is a hard time-limit, you will be stopped if you go over 5 mins

# Final Report (20 Points)

For your final report, I need:

1. A clearly formatted Quarto (`.qmd`) file that will build your
   report and any accompanying `.R` scripts that are `source()`-ed as needed
2. Either:
   - Your data will be downloaded directly as part of the project
   - You will provide clear step by step instructions (provided as Canvas text entry) for me to
      1. Go and download your data
      2. Save it so that I can replicate your report

Your report will be graded according to the final report rubric.

# Rubric

There are five major areas to the final project:

1. Data Analysis
1. Graphical/Tabular Presentation
1. Written Description
1. Organization, Clarity, and Formatting
1. Coding

### Data Analysis

1. **A strong final project** will have a data analysis that cleanly
   wrangles raw data into an analysis-ready data set; correctly
   performs all descriptive and statistical analyses necessary to
   answer the research question; and well presents the results. The
   analyses do not necessarily have to be complex, but they should
   represent the best reasonable approach.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have a data analysis that
   includes some some mistakes or inaccuracies in how the data are
   cleaned, analyses are run, and/or results are presented. The
   analyses may not be quite appropriate for the analytic task.
1. **A weak final project** data analysis will not correctly wrangle
   raw data into a clean data set, will not well describe
   relationships between predictors and the outcome, will not use
   appropriate analytic tools, and will not present results well or at
   all. In general, the analysis will be messy and unable to provide
   insights into the research questions/problems motivated in the report. 

### Graphical/Tabular Presentation

1. **A strong final project** will include nicely labeled, easy to
   understand graphics that describe exactly what is happening with
   the patterns in the data. The graphics may be simple or complex,
   but they clearly connect to the analysis (_e.g._ not just a figure
   for the sake of a figure). The response could include (but doesn't
   have to include) interactive graphics. A table or two may be
   included, but only sparingly and in a clear format.
1. **An acceptable final project** will include graphics, but these
   figures may not be easy to read, may not be sufficiently detailed,
   or may not represent the most appropriate way to show the
   relationships in the data. A table or two may be included, but not
   appropriately formatted or without a clear rationale for its
   inclusion (_i.e._ why a table and not a figure).
1. **A weak final project** will include graphics and/or tables that
   are poorly labeled and don't make much sense.

### Written Description

1. **A strong final project** will include clear and concise written
   sections that are easily understandable by an interested
   layperson. Assume that your audience is your boss or a
   colleague---not me.
1. **An acceptable final project** will be written generally well, but
   technical details may be poorly described or not described at all,
   and sentences will be hard to follow.
1. **A weak final project** will be poorly written, with many mistakes
   regarding both the analysis and good writing practices.

### Organization, Clarity, Formatting

1. **A strong final project** will have an `.qmd` file that generates a very
   nicely formatted document, suitable for professional
   presentation. What kind of report would you want to give to a
   supervisor or have given to you? That's what I want back from
   you. The organization should be very clear and easy to understand.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have some formatting problems and may
   not look very nice.
1. **A weak final project** will include code chunks in the output, poor
   formatting, and in general will just be messy.

### Coding

1. **A strong final project** will have code that can generate results from
   the raw data in an easy to understand way. The code will be
   commented and will run on my computer without my having to tweak it
   in any way. I.e., be fully reproducible. (**NOTE:** An easy test on your end is transfer your
   files to a new location with the appropriate directory structure
   and attempt to knit the document)
1. **An acceptable final project** will have code that is relatively clear,
   but that may not be commented in ways that make sense and that has
   some problems that require debugging on my end.
1. **A weak final project** will have code that is messy, hard to understand
   and not commented. It will not run on my computer, and cannot be
   easily debugged.
