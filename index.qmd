## Credit to Dr. Skinner

First and foremost, credit for the structure and vast majority of the content on this site goes to [Dr. Benjamin T. Skinner](https://www.btskinner.io) who designed this course before leaving UF to take a data scientist position at the National Endowment for the Humanities. I took this class with Dr. Skinner in Spring 2022, then was a Teaching Assistant for this class with him during Spring 2023. In building this class website, I've tried to keep the majority of the content consistent whilst making the class work for the format Dr. Tanner and I are going to teach it in.

If you're interested in seeing Dr. Skinner's versions of the class, here are links to his course site

## Class Overview

This is class will teach you the fundamentals of data management and quantiative research workflow. Often refered to informally as "the R class", you will get an introduction to writing code using the R programming language, but many of the skills are directly transferable to work in Stata or Python as well.

## The "I'm Stuck" Workflow

1)  Talk to your rubber duck
2)  Talk to your classmates
    -   Please acknowledge with a `## h/t`
3)  Try Google or Stack Overflow
    -   Please acknowledge with a `## h/t` (it helps you later too!)
    -   Caution: the internet does strange things to people... Sometimes people offering "help" can be unnecessarily blunt and/or mean, particularly to people just starting out.
4)  Matt's office hours or email
