### Course Description

Higher education researchers have a wide variety of quantitative tools at their disposal. Yet as the number and sophistication of these tools grows, so too do expectations about the quality of final analyses. Furthermore, increasing scrutiny of non-replicable results demands that researchers follow a proper workflow to mitigate errors. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of a quantitative research workflow and apply these lessons using common open-source tools. We will cover project organization, data cleaning, and exploratory analyses as well as how to run basic econometric models and recover estimates for publication. Time and interest permitting, students will also cover some special coding and/or data gathering techniques. Throughout, students will use coding best-practices so that their workflow may be shared and easily reproduced.


### Course Objectives

Students will learn:
1. A number of tools useful for conducting applied quantitative research, including:
  
  - R w/ RStudio 
  - git w/ GitHub
  - R Markdown
  
2. To properly organize a project for maximum clarity and reproducibility
3. Best practices for cleaning/tidying/wrangling raw data into analysis-ready data

### Texts

#### Required

All necessary materials are online at edquant.githbu.io/edh7916 or can be downloaded from external sources. There are no required text books for the course.

#### Recommended

Students may find some of the following books / online resources
helpful:

- Chacon, S., & Straub, B. (2014). [Pro git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Apress.
- Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2017). [R for data
  science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). O’Reilly Media.
- Healy, K. (2018). [Data visualization: A practical
  introduction](https://socviz.co). Princeton University Press.
  

### Required tools, software, and registrations

Students will be expected to bring a laptop to class. It does not matter whether the machine runs MacOS, Windows, or Linux; however, the student’s machine needs to be relatively up to date and in good running order. It needs to be able to connect to the internet during class.
All software is freely available. Students need to download and install the following software on their machines:

  - R : cran.r-project.org 
  - RStudio : rstudio.com
  - git : git-scm.com
  
NOTE that if you have installed R or RStudio on your machine in the past, make sure that you have the most up-to-date version (new versions are released about once a quarter).
You’ll also need a distribution of LaTeX. 

You have two options:

  - Recommended small install tinytex R package
  - Optional full install latex-project.org
  
Students also need to sign up for a free GitHub account if they haven’t already: github.com/join. Students should sign up using their University of Florida email address and request a Education discount at education.github.com/benefits.

### Assignments

Class participation (10%): We will use class time to work through lesson modules together. Stu- dents are expected to follow along with the presentation and run code on their own machine. Students are also expected to answer questions and work through example problems through- out the class session.

Problem sets (45%): Every lesson module will end with a set of questions that students must an- swer. Students can work together to solve the problem sets, but everyone must submit their own work and do their best to give accurate attribution for borrowed/repurposed code. In general, problem set answers will need to be submitted via GitHub a week after they are assigned.

There are a few supplemental lessons that include supplemental assignments. Though these are not required, you may find them useful. Please note that the supplemental assignments may be more difficult than the normal problem set assignments. Students may complete more than the required numbered of lessons during the second half of the course and submit the problem sets as supplemental assignments. Students may replace up to two (2) problem set submissions with submissions from the supplemental assignments.

Reproducible report(45%): Everyone must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in addition to the final report. Each product is worth the following percentage of the final grade:

  - Proposal (5%)
  - Initial set of analyses (10%) 
  - Draft of final report (10%) 
  - Final report (15%)
  - Presentation (5%)

### Honor code 

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, 

> We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to
> hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and
> integrity by abiding by the Honor Code. On all work submitted for
> credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge
> is either required or implied: “On my honor, I have neither given nor
> received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment.”  

The [Honor Code](http://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code/)
specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and
the possible sanctions. Furthermore, you are obligated to report any
condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate
personnel. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with
the instructor or TAs in this class.  

### Accommodations 

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would
like to request academic accommodations should [connect with the
disability Resource
Center](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/). It is
important for students to share their accommodation letter with their
instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the
semester.  

### Course evaluations 

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback
on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course
evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in
a professional and respectful manner is available
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/). Students will be
notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete
evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their
Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or
[here](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/). Summaries of course evaluation
results are available to students
[here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).
  
### In-class recording

Students are allowed to record video or audio of class
lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used
are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are (1) for per-
sonal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the
university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal
or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically,
students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent
of the instructor.  

A "class lecture" is an educational presentation intended to inform or
teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any
instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and
delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or
by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A
class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations,
clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises
involving solely student participa- tion, assessments (quizzes, tests,
exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the
class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class
session.  

Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To
"publish" means to share, trans- mit, circulate, distribute, or
provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to an-
other person (or persons), including but not limited to another
student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or
transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on
or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but
not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or
third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a
recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of
action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or
discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student
Conduct Code.  

### A note about taking class during the COVID-19 pandemic

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the ways we live
each day. We are each trying to keep to "normal" routines all while
attending to our health and the health of those we care
about---sometimes nearby and sometimes from far away. I find this
difficult and I imagine that you might as well.

Two things are true this term. On one hand, we are to continue working
with and learning from one another. It's what we do as scholars, yet
more mundanely, taking this course also represents progress toward
your degree and career goals, which haven’t necessarily paused. On the
other hand, many of the structures that support your academic progress
are currently lacking and, in some cases, non-existent. People are
different. Some will appreciate the distraction that coursework can
offer; others will find it difficult to concentrate. During this term,
you may yourself alternate between being both of these people.

All of this is to say that flexible will be our watchword this
semester. In the next pages, you will see the assignments that
determine your grade as well as the tentative course schedule. Who
knows what this semester will bring, so if you will be flexible with
me, I promise to be flexible with you. This is my typical policy, but
I want to make it explicit this term. If you are having difficulties,
please let me know so that we can do whatever needs to be done for you
to be well and successful. You need not share personal details---please
simply keep me in the loop.
