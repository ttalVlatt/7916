# Proposal

From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report. 

**This assignment represents the first of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your final project proposal, I need the following in a cleanly
formatted Markdown (`.md`) file:

1. A paragraph describing your project: 
   - What will you be predicting?
   - Why is it interesting?
1. A description of where you will find this data.
1. A few lines describing your dependent variable in detail. What is
   the nature of this outcome as a variable?

#### Submission details

- Save your file as `<name>_proposal.md` where your last name
  replaces `<name>` (_e.g._ `skinner_proposal.md`) in your
  `final_project` folder
- Push to your GitHub repo prior to the start of the class in which it
  is due. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed your
  changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If you
  can see your changes there, I can see them too.

# Initial Analyses

From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in

addition to the final report. 

**This assignment represents the second of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your initial analyses, I need the following in either a cleanly
formatted R (`.R`) script or RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file:

1. Code that:
   - Reads in the data set that contains your dependent variable
   - **[If appropriate]** Converts missing values to NA 
   - **[If appropriate]** Reshapes data
   - **[If appropriate]** Joins data
1. **3** of the **4** following plots:
   - A univariate graphic describing the dependent variable (_e.g._
      histogram)
   - The conditional mean of your dependent variable at levels of at
     least one independent variable (_e.g._ box-and-whisker)
   - The distribution of your dependent variable at levels of at least
     one independent variable (_e.g._ grouped density plot, faceted
     density plot)
   - A bivariate graphic that compares your dependent variable with at
     least one other independent variable (_e.g._ scatter plot)

#### Submission details

- Save your file as: 
  - `<name>_analyses.R` (if submitting an R script)
  - `<name>_analyses.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd file)
  
  where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._ `skinner_analyses.R` or
  `skinner_analyses.Rmd`) in your `final_project` folder.
- Push to your GitHub repo prior to the start of the class in which it
  is due. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed your
  changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If you
  can see your changes there, I can see them too.

# Draft Report

From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report.

**This assignment represents the third of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your draft report, I need the following in a cleanly formatted
RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file:

1. Well commented code that:
   - Reads in your raw data set
   - Performs all necessary data wrangling tasks to clean, join, and
     reshape your data as necessary for your project
   - Performs all necessary analyses
1. Plots (as necessary, but required) to show the results of your analyses
1. Tables (as necessary, but not required) to show the results of your
   analyses
1. First draft of the written elements of your report; these elements
   should:
   - Motivate your analyses
   - Describe your data
   - Describe your methodological approach, in high-level,
     audience-appropriate manner (think your boss or colleagues, not
     me specifically)
   - Describe your findings
   - Appropriately contextualize your results (_e.g._ limitations,
     validity) and make appropriate recommendations
   - **[If necessary]** Include citations
   - Be well organized

_Please also submit your raw data files so that I can run your
script. If your files are very large (too large push to GitHub,
contact me so that we can figure out another way for you to get your
data to me._

#### Submission details

- Save your file as: `<name>_draft_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
  file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._
  `skinner_draft_report.Rmd`) in your `final_project` folder.
- Submit data files (zipped if necessary)
- Push to your GitHub repo prior to the start of the class in which it
  is due. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed your
  changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If you
  can see your changes there, I can see them too.

**This assignment represents the final report.**

For your final report, I need:

1. A clearly formatted RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file that will build your
   report
1. Either:
   - A copy of your data
   - _Very clear_ instructions on how to get your data

Your report will be graded according to the final report rubric.

#### Submission details

- Save your file as: `<name>_final_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
  file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._
  `skinner_final_report.Rmd`) in your `final_project` folder.
- Push to your GitHub repo prior to the start of the class in which it
  is due. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed your

# Rubric

There are five major areas to the final project:

1. Data Analysis
1. Graphical/Tabular Presentation
1. Written Description
1. Organization, Clarity, and Formatting
1. Coding

### Data Analysis

1. **A strong final project** will have a data analysis that cleanly
   wrangles raw data into an analysis-ready data set; correctly
   performs all descriptive and statistical analyses necessary to
   answer the research question; and well presents the results. The
   analyses do not necessarily have to be complex, but they should
   represent the best reasonable approach.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have a data analysis that
   includes some some mistakes or inaccuracies in how the data are
   cleaned, analyses are run, and/or results are presented. The
   analyses may not be quite appropriate for the analytic task.
1. **A weak final project** data analysis will not correctly wrangle
   raw data into a clean data set, will not well describe
   relationships between predictors and the outcome, will not use
   appropriate analytic tools, and will not present results well or at
   all. In general, the analysis will be messy and unable to provide
   insights into the research questions/problems motivated in the report. 

### Graphical/Tabular Presentation

1. **A strong final project** will include nicely labeled, easy to
   understand graphics that describe exactly what is happening with
   the patterns in the data. The graphics may be simple or complex,
   but they clearly connect to the analysis (_e.g._ not just a figure
   for the sake of a figure). The response could include (but doesn't
   have to include) interactive graphics. A table or two may be
   included, but only sparingly and in a clear format.
1. **An acceptable final project** will include graphics, but these
   figures may not be easy to read, may not be sufficiently detailed,
   or may not represent the most appropriate way to show the
   relationships in the data. A table or two may be included, but not
   appropriately formatted or without a clear rationale for its
   inclusion (_i.e._ why a table and not a figure).
1. **A weak final project** will include graphics and/or tables that
   are poorly labeled and don't make much sense.

### Written Description

1. **A strong final project** will include clear and concise written
   sections that are easily understandable by an interested
   layperson. Assume that your audience is your boss or a
   colleague---not me.
1. **An acceptable final project** will be written generally well, but
   technical details may be poorly described or not described at all,
   and sentences will be hard to follow.
1. **A weak final project** will be poorly written, with many mistakes
   regarding both the analysis and good writing practices.

### Organization, Clarity, Formatting

1. **A strong final project** will have an `.Rmd` file that generates a very
   nicely formatted document, suitable for professional
   presentation. What kind of report would you want to give to a
   supervisor or have given to you? That's what I want back from
   you. The organization should be very clear and easy to understand.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have some formatting problems and may
   not look very nice.
1. **A weak final project** will include code chunks in the output, poor
   formatting, and in general will just be messy.

### Coding

1. **A strong final project** will have code that can generate results from
   the raw data in an easy to understand way. The code will be
   commented and will run on my computer without my having to tweak it
   in any way. (**NOTE:** An easy test on your end is transfer your
   files to a new location with the appropriate directory structure
   and attempt to knit the document)
1. **An acceptable final project** will have code that is relatively clear,
   but that may not be commented in ways that make sense and that has
   some problems that require debugging on my end.
1. **A weak final project** will have code that is messy, hard to understand
   and not commented. It will not run on my computer, and cannot be
   easily debugged.
