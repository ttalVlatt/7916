Higher education researchers have a wide variety of quantitative tools
at their disposal. Yet as the number and sophistication of these tools
grows, so too do expectations about the quality of final
analyses. Furthermore, increasing scrutiny of non-replicable results
demands that researchers follow a proper workflow to mitigate
errors. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of a
quantitative research workflow and apply these lessons using common
open-source tools. We will cover project organization, data cleaning,
and exploratory analyses as well as how to run basic econometric
models and recover estimates for publication. Throughout, students
will use coding best-practices so that their workflow may be shared
and easily reproduced.

In this course, students will learn:

1. To use a number of tools that are useful for conducting applied
   quantitative research including
   - [R](https://cran.r-project.org) with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)
   - [git](https://git-scm.com) with [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
1. To properly organize a project for maximum clarity and
   reproducibility
1. Best practices for cleaning/tidying/wrangling raw data into
   analysis-ready data
