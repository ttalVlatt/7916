Using the `tigris` library and code from the [mapping/API
lesson](../lessons/mapping_api.html), make a different point map
following the instructions below:

1. Modify the `tidycensus` code to download data for a different
   geography and different variable, and make a new base map
2. Use the same academic libraries IPEDS data (unless you have
   something else you want to plot for your final assignment) to plot
   points on your new base, using a different variable for the
   aesthetic. 
   - You _can_ experiment with other aesthetics, but sticking with
      size is fine
    
That's all you need to do to complete the assignment. Have fun!

#### Submission details

- Save your script (`<lastname>_assignment_12.R` in your `scripts` directory.
- Push changes to your repo (the new script and new folder) to GitHub
  prior to the next class session.
