Using the `hsls_small.dta` data set (the Stata version) and the online
codebook, make plots that help answer each of the following
questions. You **do not** need to save the final plot. Throughout, you
**should** account for missing values by dropping them.

For each question, show your data work and write 1-2 sentence(s) in a
comment that describes the relationship your plot shows (_i.e._, how
it answers the question).

## Questions

1. What is the distribution of household size among students in the
   sample?
1. How does student socioeconomic status differ between students who
   ever attended college and those who did not?
1. How do parental educational expectations differ across region?
1. How does the relationship between socioeconomic status and math
   test score differ across region (use a smoothing line to help show
   any relationship)?
1. Among students who ever attended college, how does socioeconomic
   status differ between those who delayed postsecondary enrollment
   and those who did not delay, when delay is defined as:
   - more than 6 months between high school graduation and
     postsecondary enrollment?
   - more than 12 months?
<!-- 1. **BONUS** Using the [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) library, -->
<!--    recreate one of the plots from the lesson, but add an interactive -->
<!--    component. For example, in one of the scatter plots, make it so -->
<!--    that hovering over a point produces a pop-up that shows its value -->
<!--    and the student to which it belongs. -->

#### Submission details

- Save your script (`<lastname>_assignment_5.R`) in your `scripts`
