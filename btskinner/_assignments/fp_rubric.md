There are five major areas to the final project:

1. Data Analysis
1. Graphical/Tabular Presentation
1. Written Description
1. Organization, Clarity, and Formatting
1. Coding

### Data Analysis

1. **A strong final project** will have a data analysis that cleanly
   wrangles raw data into an analysis-ready data set; correctly
   performs all descriptive and statistical analyses necessary to
   answer the research question; and well presents the results. The
   analyses do not necessarily have to be complex, but they should
   represent the best reasonable approach.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have a data analysis that
   includes some some mistakes or inaccuracies in how the data are
   cleaned, analyses are run, and/or results are presented. The
   analyses may not be quite appropriate for the analytic task.
1. **A weak final project** data analysis will not correctly wrangle
   raw data into a clean data set, will not well describe
   relationships between predictors and the outcome, will not use
   appropriate analytic tools, and will not present results well or at
   all. In general, the analysis will be messy and unable to provide
   insights into the research questions/problems motivated in the report. 

### Graphical/Tabular Presentation

1. **A strong final project** will include nicely labeled, easy to
   understand graphics that describe exactly what is happening with
   the patterns in the data. The graphics may be simple or complex,
   but they clearly connect to the analysis (_e.g._ not just a figure
   for the sake of a figure). The response could include (but doesn't
   have to include) interactive graphics. A table or two may be
   included, but only sparingly and in a clear format.
1. **An acceptable final project** will include graphics, but these
   figures may not be easy to read, may not be sufficiently detailed,
   or may not represent the most appropriate way to show the
   relationships in the data. A table or two may be included, but not
   appropriately formatted or without a clear rationale for its
   inclusion (_i.e._ why a table and not a figure).
1. **A weak final project** will include graphics and/or tables that
   are poorly labeled and don't make much sense.

### Written Description

1. **A strong final project** will include clear and concise written
   sections that are easily understandable by an interested
   layperson. Assume that your audience is your boss or a
   colleague---not me.
1. **An acceptable final project** will be written generally well, but
   technical details may be poorly described or not described at all,
   and sentences will be hard to follow.
1. **A weak final project** will be poorly written, with many mistakes
   regarding both the analysis and good writing practices.

### Organization, Clarity, Formatting

1. **A strong final project** will have an `.Rmd` file that generates a very
   nicely formatted document, suitable for professional
   presentation. What kind of report would you want to give to a
   supervisor or have given to you? That's what I want back from
   you. The organization should be very clear and easy to understand.
1. **An acceptable final project** will have some formatting problems and may
   not look very nice.
1. **A weak final project** will include code chunks in the output, poor
   formatting, and in general will just be messy.

### Coding

1. **A strong final project** will have code that can generate results from
   the raw data in an easy to understand way. The code will be
   commented and will run on my computer without my having to tweak it
   in any way. (**NOTE:** An easy test on your end is transfer your
   files to a new location with the appropriate directory structure
   and attempt to knit the document)
1. **An acceptable final project** will have code that is relatively clear,
   but that may not be commented in ways that make sense and that has
   some problems that require debugging on my end.
1. **A weak final project** will have code that is messy, hard to understand
   and not commented. It will not run on my computer, and cannot be
   easily debugged.
