GitHub">Issue</a>

If you have a question about the course, please file an <a
class="github-button"
href="https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen"
aria-label="Issue edquant/edh7916 on GitHub">Issue</a> on our course
site's GitHub repository. This will allow others --- who likely have a
similar question --- to see and even participate in the discussion and
resolution. You'll need to sign into GitHub with your account, but you
can file an issue through the website (no need to use git or special
software).

Questions about all aspects of the course are fair game, including
lessons and assignments. You can even submit suggestions and general
interest notes (FYIs). 

To help organize everything, I've included the following labels on the
issues page:

<div id="gitlabels"></div>

Remember that others can search these issues (that's the whole point)
so try to give your question or suggestion a useful name.

**Because issues are public, please don't share personal information ---
just send me an email if you have a FERPA-related question (_e.g._
grades, extensions, _etc_).**

One last note: when looking at past issues, you may want to look at
both the [Open](https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues) and
[Closed](https://github.com/edquant/edh7916/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
issues. A closed issue is just one that has been answered in a past
version of the course. It may have the answer you need.
