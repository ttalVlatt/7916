**Assignments are due before class in the week after we finish a
lesson**

In addition, we'll may have a number of self-directed lessons that
each student can select among to work on during class time based on
their research interests. These include:

- Inferential I: Correlations, _t_-tests, and weights
- Inferential II: Regression and prediction
- Data visualization with ggplot2 II
- Interactive graphics
- Functional programming II
- High performance R with Rcpp
- Web scraping in R
- Introduction to mapping in R

Along the way, you'll have parts of your final project due. These are
due on the following weeks/dates:

| Week                     | Final project component due              |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| **Week 4** <br/> (1/31)  | < Final project: proposal                |
| **Week 10** <br/> (3/14) | **SPRING BREAK**            |
| **Week 12** <br/> (3/28) | < Final project: initial set of analyses |
| **Week 15** <br/> (4/11) | < Final project: draft of final report   |
| **Week 16** <br/> (4/25) | > Presentations                          |
| **FINALS** <br/> (5/2)   | < Final project: final report            |
