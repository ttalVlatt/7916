From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report.

**This assignment represents the final report.**

For your final report, I need:

1. A clearly formatted RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file that will build your
   report
1. Either:
   - A copy of your data
   - _Very clear_ instructions on how to get your data

Your report will be graded according to the final report rubric.

#### Submission details

- Upload to our CANVAS course site no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on the
  due date 
- Save your file as: `<name>_final_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
  file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._
  `skinner_final_report.Rmd`)
