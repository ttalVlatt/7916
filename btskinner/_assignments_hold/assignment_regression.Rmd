Using `els_plans.dta`, please answer the following questions. Use
comments to respond as necessary.

## Questions

1. Using this multiple regression model from the lesson, 
   ```r
   lm(bynels2m ~ byses1 + female + moth_ba + fath_ba + lowinc, data = df)
   ```
   add the fitted values to the residuals and store in an object,
   `x`. Compare these values to the math scores in the data frame.
1. Using this multiple regression model from the lesson,
   ```r
   lm(bynels2m ~ byses1 + female + moth_ba + fath_ba + lowinc + factor(bystexp),
      data = df)
   ```
   Add the categorical variable `byincome` to the model above. Next
   use `model.matrix()` to check the RHS matrix.
1. Fit a linear model with both interactions and a polynomial
   term. Then look at the model matrix to see what R did under the
   hood. 
1. Fit a logit or probit model to another binary outcome than what was
   selected in the lesson (other than `plan_col_grad`: you can make a
   new one if you want).
