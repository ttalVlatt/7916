From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report. 

**This assignment represents the first of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your final project proposal, I need the following in a cleanly
formatted Markdown (`.md`) file:

1. A paragraph describing your project: 
   - What will you be predicting?
   - Why is it interesting?
1. A description of where you will find this data.
1. A few lines describing your dependent variable in detail. What is
   the nature of this outcome as a variable?

#### Submission details

- Upload to our CANVAS course site no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on the
  due date 
- Save your file as `<name>_proposal.md` where your last name
  replaces `<name>` (_e.g._ `skinner_proposal.md`)
