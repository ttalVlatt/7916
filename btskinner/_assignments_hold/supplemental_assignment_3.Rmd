Scrape the [NCES Table
501.80](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_501.80.asp)
and make a graph that answers the following question:

> How do unemployment rates among 25-64 year olds of various education
> levels (less than high school, high school completion, some college,
> and Bachelor's degree or higher) compare and change from 1975 to
> 2017? 

You **do not** need to save the final output as a data file: just
having the final result print to the console is fine. In addition to
making a graph, show your data work and give a one paragraph
explanation of your findings.
