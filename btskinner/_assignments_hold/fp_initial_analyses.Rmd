From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in

addition to the final report. 

**This assignment represents the second of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your initial analyses, I need the following in either a cleanly
formatted R (`.R`) script or RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file:

1. Code that:
   - Reads in the data set that contains your dependent variable
   - **[If appropriate]** Converts missing values to NA 
   - **[If appropriate]** Reshapes data
   - **[If appropriate]** Joins data
1. **3** of the **4** following plots:
   - A univariate graphic describing the dependent variable (_e.g._
      histogram)
   - The conditional mean of your dependent variable at levels of at
     least one independent variable (_e.g._ box-and-whisker)
   - The distribution of your dependent variable at levels of at least
     one independent variable (_e.g._ grouped density plot, faceted
     density plot)
   - A bivariate graphic that compares your dependent variable with at
     least one other independent variable (_e.g._ scatter plot)

#### Submission details

- Upload to our CANVAS course site no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on the
  due date 
- Save your file as: 
  - `<name>_analyses.R` (if submitting an R script)
  - `<name>_analyses.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd file)
  
  where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._ `skinner_analyses.R` or
  `skinner_analyses.Rmd`)
