Using `hsls_small`, please answer the following questions. Use
comments to respond as necessary.

## Questions

1. Create an interactive histogram using another continuous variable
in the `hsls_small` data set. You can make either a frequency or
density histogram. 
1. Create an interactive two-way histogram using another grouping
variable in the `hsls_small` data set (something other than parental
college). You can use an existing indicator variable or create your
own. 
1. Create an interactive 3D scatter plot using SES, math scores, and a
categorical variable with more than two groups. This means your legend
should more than two items and your graph should have more than two
colors. Note that you likely need to increase the number of colors in
`pal` (you can find more hex codes at
[https://htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com)) or remove
the argument altogether.
1. **BONUS** Try to make an interactive figure using `hsls_small`
   unlike one we made in lesson. Use the examples from
   [https://plotly.com/r/](https://plotly.com/r/).
