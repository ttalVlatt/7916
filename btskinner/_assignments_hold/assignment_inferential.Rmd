Using `els_plans.dta`, please answer the following questions. Use
comments to respond as necessary.

## Questions

1. Run a correlation of both math and reading scores against whether
 the father has a Bachelor's degree (`fath_ba`) or the mother has a
 Bachelor's degree (`moth_ba`). In what ways, if any, is this
 different than what you get when using the combined `par_ba`
 indicator variable? 
1. Run a t-test of reading scores against whether the father has a
   Bachelor's degree (`fath_ba`).
1. Compare this to the output from `t.test()` above. How is it
   different?

#### Submission details
