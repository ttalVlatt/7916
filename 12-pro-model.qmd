# Lesson

First off, I am not a stats professor, and this is not a stats lesson. Some of you have taken years of stats classes, while others are yet to take any. The purpose of this lesson is meant to focus on the R and programmatic aspects of modeling than statistical theory. 

That said, it may still be a lot for those less familiar with stats. Fear not, there is no expectation to use of any this in your final assignment, nor is there an assignment for this lesson (optional final project drafts are due Sunday)! 

If this lesson starts to go over your comfort level, that's completely fine! Try your best to follow along, and maybe revisit the website once you're a little further along your stats jounrey.

## t-test

## lm

### extracting predictions

### checking residuals

### assumption checking packages

## formula objects

## modeling programatically with loops

# Assignment

No assignment for this week, optional drafts of your reproducible report are due Sunday!
