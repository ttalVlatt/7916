# Lesson

Note: The Quarto lesson will be really helpful for the assignment here, so probably don't attempt this until after then!

- Many of you are likely using IPEDS for your final project, and most those who aren't will likely use IPEDS at some point in the future
  - By completing this extra credit you will learn to use a tool to download IPEDS directly with an R script
    - This extra credit is relatively simple, however, the challenge is that I am not providing step-by-step instructions, just a link to the resource
    
## Download IPEDS by Dr. Skinner

- Dr. Skinner, the original instructor of the class, wrote an R script that downloads IPEDS files directly to a project folder
  - I actually used this for my final project when I took the class with him
  - Doing this enables true "push button reproducibility" of your report
    - As in, all I need to do to replicate your report is hit "render", no pre-downloading of the data required
    
- [Download IPEDS is an R-script available on Dr. Skinner's personal website, here](https://www.btskinner.io/code/download-ipeds/)

- That's all the instruction you get for this lesson, Dr. Skinner's site should be enough to work out the rest. Turn to the assignment tab to see how to earn the extra credit points
  - The purpose of this limited instruction is to push you a little into playing with reasources you find in the wild!
  
# Assignment

There are two ways you can get credit for this, either

1. Utilize download IPEDS in your final reproducible report (simply say so in the Canvas text entry box option)
  - Hint: you're going to want to `source()` the download ipeds script from your `.qmd` script
  *or*
2. If you don't use any IPEDS data in your report, submit any `.qmd` file that sources a download IPEDS script and then reads the downloaded data in
  - If you go this route, please don't put time into putting anything else in the scripts, I just want to see you download the data and read it in
  
- Hint: Depending on the data you select, you might need to `unzip()` the files before reading them in.
  
- Word of caution: while you don't have to, I'd recommend editing the `.txt` file to only download the files you want, not the whole of IPEDS
