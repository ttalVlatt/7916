# Scripts

Scripts from the website (pulled from the module) will be in this
directory. All of your problem set R scripts should go in this
directory as well.

**Important Note!** If you want to take notes on the scripts, resave
them using a slightly different name. For example, if the script for
the first lesson is called `intro.R` and you take notes in it during
class --- a good practice --- be sure to save it as something like
`intro_<your_initials>.R`. 

The reason is this: when I update the website, all files that I make
from the site and then send to your repo will revert back to their
original form (or with any changes I make). Updates to the site,
however, **will not**, affect new files you create. So just change the
name and you will be fine.

You've been warned!
