# Assignments

Assignments will appear in this directory as they are added to the
course site. You can also access them at
[edquant.github.io/edh7916/assignments/](https://edquant.github.io/edh7916/assignments/).

Unless otherwise noted, assignments are due one week from the time
they are given. You will submit your work via your personal GitHub
repo, which you share with me. I will pull down from your repo at the
time the assignment is due. This means you can add, commit, and push
changes (make sure you `git push` to the remote!) as many times as you
want until the deadline. I would suggest commiting and pushing changes
as you work rather than just once at the end.

Also unless other noted, save your assignments in your `scripts`
directory using the following format:
`<name_of_assignment>_<your_last_name>`. For example, if the first
assignment is called `Introduction`, then name your file
`introduction_skinner.R`.
