From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report.

**This assignment represents the final report.**

For your final report, I need:

1. A clearly formatted RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file that will build your
   report
1. Either:
   - A copy of your data
   - _Very clear_ instructions on how to get your data

Your report will be graded according to the final report rubric.

#### Submission details

- Save your file as: `<name>_final_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
  file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._
  `skinner_final_report.Rmd`) in your `final_project` folder.
- Push to your GitHub repo prior to the start of the class in which it
  is due. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed your
  changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If you
  can see your changes there, I can see them too.
