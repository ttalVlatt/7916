So far, we have only worked with single data files: we read in a file,
wrangled our data, and, sometimes, outputted a new file. But very
often, a key aspect of the data wrangling workflow is to combine more
than one data set together. This may include **appending** new rows to an
existing data frame in memory or **joining** two data sets together using
a common key value found in both. Another key data manipulation task
is to **reshape** our data, pivoting from wide to long form (or vice
versa). We'll go through each individually below.

# Data

After you download and unzip the data for today's lesson, move the
full folder, `sch_test`, into the `data` subdirectory. It should look
something like this:

```
|__ data/
    |-- ...
    |__ sch_test/
        |-- all_schools.csv
        |-- all_schools_wide.csv
        |__ by_school/
            |-- bend_gate_1980.csv
            |-- bend_gate_1981.csv
            |...
            |-- spottsville_1985.csv
```

These fake data represent test scores across three subjects --- math,
reading, and science --- across four schools over six years. Each
school has a file for each year in the `by_school` subdirectory. The
two files in `sch_test` directory, `all_schools.csv` and
`all_schools_wide.csv`, combine the individual files but in different
formats. We'll use these data sets to practice appending, joining, and
reshaping.

# Setup

As always, we begin by reading in the tidyverse library and
assigning our paths to macros we can reuse below. 

```{r, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
source('knit_setup.R')
```

```{r, include = FALSE, purl = TRUE}

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## libraries
## ---------------------------

library(tidyverse)
```

As we did in the past lesson, we run this script assuming that
our working directory is set to the `scripts` directory. Notice that
we also include macros for our subdirectories within the `data`
directory. Since they are nested, we can use the previous macros to
set new macros. 

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## directory paths
## ---------------------------

## assume we're running this script from the ./scripts subdirectory
dat_dir <- file.path("..", "data")
sch_dir <- file.path(dat_dir, "sch_test")  # use dat_dir
bys_dir <- file.path(sch_dir, "by_school") # use sch_dir
```

# Appending data

Our first task is the most straightforward. When appending data, we
simply add similarly structured rows to an exiting data frame. What do
I mean by similarly structured? Imagine you have a data frame that
looks like this:

| id | year | score |
|:--:|:----:|:-----:|
| A  | 2020 | 98    |
| B  | 2020 | 95    |
| C  | 2020 | 85    |
| D  | 2020 | 94    |

Now, assume you are given data that look like this:

| id | year | score |
|:--:|:----:|:-----:|
| E  | 2020 | 99    |
| F  | 2020 | 90    |

These data are similarly structured: _same column names in the same
order_. If we know that the data came from the same process (_e.g._,
**id**s represent students in the same classroom with each file
representing a different test day), then we can safely append the
second to the first:

| id  | year   | score |
|:---:|:------:|:-----:|
| A   | 2020   | 98    |
| B   | 2020   | 95    |
| C   | 2020   | 85    |
| D   | 2020   | 94    |
| _E_ | _2020_ | _99_  |
| _F_ | _2020_ | _90_  |

Data that are the result of the _exact_ same data collecting process
across locations or time may be appended. In education research,
administrative data are often recorded each term or year, meaning you
can build a panel data set by appending. The NCES IPEDS data files
generally work like this.

However, it's incumbent upon you as the researcher to understand your
data. Just because you are able to append (R will try to make it work
for you) doesn't mean you always should. What if the `score` column in
our data weren't on the same scale? What if the test date mattered but
isn't included in the file? What if the files actually represent
scores from different grades or schools? It's possible that we can
account for each of these issues as we clean our data, but it won't
happen automatically --- append with care!

<!-- > situations in which appending data frames may not be a good idea. -->

```{r, purl = TRUE, include = FALSE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Append data
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Example

Let's practice with an example. First, we'll read in three data files
from the `by_school` directory.

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## input
## ---------------------------

## read in data, storing in df_*, where * is a unique number
df_1 <- read_csv(file.path(bys_dir, "bend_gate_1980.csv"))
df_2 <- read_csv(file.path(bys_dir, "bend_gate_1981.csv"))
df_3 <- read_csv(file.path(bys_dir, "bend_gate_1982.csv"))
```

Looking at each, we can see that they are similarly structured, with
the following columns in the same order: `school`, `year`, `math`,
`read`, `science`:

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## process
## ---------------------------

## show each
df_1
df_2
df_3
```

From the dplyr library, we use the
[`bind_rows()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html)
function to append the second and third data frames to the first.

```{r}
## append files
df <- bind_rows(df_1, df_2, df_3)

## show
df
```
That's it!

> current data frame.

# Joining data

More often than appending your data files, however, you will need to
merge or join them. With a join, you add to your data frame new
columns (new variables) that come from a second data frame. The key
difference between joining and appending is that a join requires a
_key_, that is, a variable or index common to each data frame that
uniquely identifies observations. It's this key that's used to line
everything up.

For example, say you have these two data sets,

| id | sch | year | score |
|:--:|:---:|------|:-----:|
| A  | 1   | 2020 | 98    |
| B  | 1   | 2020 | 95    |
| C  | 2   | 2020 | 85    |
| D  | 3   | 2020 | 94    |

| sch | type       |
|:---:|:----------:|
| 1   | elementary |
| 2   | middle     |
| 3   | high       |

and you want to add the school `type` to the first data set. You can
do this because you have a common _key_ between each set: `sch`. A
pseudocode description of this join would be:

1. Add a column to the first data frame called `type`
1. Fill in each row of the new column with the `type` value that
   corresponds to the matching `sch` value in both data frames:
   - `sch == 1 --> elementary`
   - `sch == 2 --> middle`
   - `sch == 3 --> high`

The end result would then look like this:

| id | sch | year | score | type       |
|:--:|:---:|------|:-----:|:-----------|
| A  | 1   | 2020 | 98    | elementary |
| B  | 1   | 2020 | 95    | elementary |
| C  | 2   | 2020 | 85    | middle     |
| D  | 3   | 2020 | 94    | high       |

## Example

```{r, purl = TRUE, include = FALSE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Join data
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

A common join task in education research involves adding group-level
aggregate statistics to individual observations: for example, adding
school-level average test scores to each student's row. With a panel
data set (observations across time), we might want within-year
averages added to each unit-by-time period row. Let's do the second,
adding within-year across school average test scores to each
school-by-year observation.

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## input
## ---------------------------

## read in all_schools data
df <- read_csv(file.path(sch_dir, "all_schools.csv"))
```

Looking at the data, we see that it's similar to what we've seen
above, with additional schools.

```{r}
## show
df
```

Our task is two-fold:

1. Get the average of each test score (math, reading, science) across
   all schools within each year and save the summary data frame in an
   object.
1. Join the new summary data frame to the original data frame.

### 1. Get summary

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## process
## ---------------------------

## get test score summary 
df_sum <- df %>%
    ## grouping by year so average within each year
    group_by(year) %>%
    ## get mean(<score>) for each test
    summarize(math_m = mean(math),
              read_m = mean(read),
              science_m = mean(science))

## show
df_sum
```

> summarized columns? Why the `_m` ending?

### 2. Join

While one can [`merge` using base
R](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/merge.html),
dplyr uses the [SQL language of
joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)), which can be
conceptually clearer (particularly for those who already have
experience with relational database structures). Here are the most
common joins you will use:

- `left_join(x, y)`: keep all x, drop unmatched y
- `right_join(x, y)`: keep all y, drop unmatched x
- `inner_join(x, y)`: keep only matching
- `full_join(x, y)`: keep everything

![In the Venn diagrams above, blue represents the observations that are
kept, white the observations that are dropped.](/edh7916/assets/img/joins.png)

For example, the result of a **left join** between data frame _X_ and
data frame _Y_ will include all observations in _X_ and those in _Y_
that are also in
_X_.  

**X**

| id  | col\_A | col\_B |
|:---:|:------:|:------:|
| 001 | a      | 1      |
| 002 | b      | 2      |
| 003 | a      | 3      |

**Y**

| id  | col\_C | col\_D |
|:---:|:------:|:------:|
| 001 | T      | 9      |
| 002 | T      | 9      |
| 004 | F      | 9      |

**XY** (result of left join)

| id  | col\_A | col\_B | col\_C | col\_D |
|:---:|:-------|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 001 | a      | 1      | T      | 9      |
| 002 | b      | 2      | T      | 9      |
| 003 | a      | 3      | NA     | NA     |

Observations in both _X_ and _Y_ (`001` and `002`, above), will have
data for the columns that were separately in _X_ and _Y_ before. Those
in _X_ only (`003`), will have missing values in the new columns that
came from _Y_ because they didn't exist there. Observations in _Y_ but
not _X_ (`004`) are dropped entirely.

Back to our example...

Since we want to join a smaller aggregated data frame, `df_sum`, to
the original data frame, `df`, we'll use a `left_join()`. The join
functions will try to guess the joining variable (and tell you what it
picked) if you don't supply one, but we'll specify one to be clear.

```{r}
## start with data frame...
df_joined <- df %>%
    ## pipe into left_join to join with df_sum using "year" as key
    left_join(df_sum, by = "year")

## show
df_joined
```

# Reshaping data

Reshaping data is a common data wrangling task. Whether going from
[wide to long format or long to
wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data), it can be
a painful process. But with a little practice, the ability to reshape
data will become a powerful tool in your toolbox.

## Definitions

While there are various definitions of tabular data structure, the two
you will most often come across are **wide** and **long**. Wide data
are data structures in which all variable/values are columns. At the
extreme end, every _id_ will only have a single row:


| id | math_score_2019 | read_score_2019 | math_score_2020 | read_score_2020 |
|:--:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| A  | 93              | 88              | 92              | 98              |
| B  | 99              | 92              | 97              | 95              |
| C  | 89              | 88              | 84              | 85              |

Notice how each particular score (by year) has its own column?
Compare this to long data in which each _observational unit_ (id test
score within a given year) will have a row:

| id | year | test | score |
|:--:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| A  | 2019 | math | 93    |
| A  | 2019 | read | 88    |
| A  | 2020 | math | 92    |
| A  | 2020 | read | 98    |
| B  | 2019 | math | 99    |
| B  | 2019 | read | 92    |
| B  | 2020 | math | 97    |
| B  | 2020 | read | 95    |
| C  | 2019 | math | 89    |
| C  | 2019 | read | 88    |
| C  | 2020 | math | 84    |
| C  | 2020 | read | 85    |

The first wide and second long table present the same information in a
different format. So why bother reshaping? The short answer is that
you sometimes need one format and sometimes the other due to the
demands of the analysis you want to run, the figure you want to plot,
or the table you want to make.

**NB**: Data in the wild are often some combination of these two
types: _wide-ish_ or _long-ish_. For an example, see our
`all_schools.csv` data below, which is wide in some variables (test),
but long in others (year). The point of defining long vs wide is not
to have a testable definition, but rather to have a framework for
thinking about how your data are structured and if that structure will
work for your data analysis needs.

```{r, purl = TRUE, include = FALSE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Reshape data
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Example: wide --> long

To start, we'll go back to the `all_schools.csv` file.

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## input
## ---------------------------

## reading again just to be sure we have the original data
df <- read_csv(file.path(sch_dir, "all_schools.csv"))
```

Notice how the data are wide in **test**: each school has one row per
year, but each test gets its own column. While this setup can be
efficient for storage, it's not always the best for analysis or even
just browsing. What we want is for the data to be long.

Instead of each test having its own column, we would like to make the
data look like our long data example above, with each row representing
a single _school_, _year_, _test_, _score_:

| school    | year | test | score                                                            |
|:----------|:----:|:-----|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Bend Gate | 1980 | math | `r dplyr::filter(df, school == "Bend Gate", year == 1980) %>% dplyr::pull(math)` |
| Bend Gate | 1980 | read | `r dplyr::filter(df, school == "Bend Gate", year == 1980) %>% dplyr::pull(read)` |
| Bend Gate | 1980 | science | `r dplyr::filter(df, school == "Bend Gate", year == 1980) %>% dplyr::pull(science)` |
| ... |...|...|...|


As with joins, you can [reshape data frames using base R
commands](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-can-i-reshape-my-data-in-r/).
But again, we'll use tidyverse functions in the
[tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org) library. Specifically, we'll rely
on the tidyr `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()` commands.

### `pivot_longer()`

The `pivot_longer()` function can take a number of arguments, but the
core things it needs to know are:

- `data`: the name of the data frame you're reshaping (we can use
  `%>%` to pipe in the data name)
- `cols`: the names of the columns that you want to pivot into values
  of a single new column (thereby making the data frame "longer")
- `names_to`: the name of the new column that will contain the names
  of the `cols` you just listed
- `values_to`: the name of the column where the values in the `cols`
  you listed will go
  
In our current situation, our `cols` to pivot are `"math"`, `"read"`, and
`"science"`. Since they are test types, we'll call our `names_to` column
`"test"` and our `values_to` column `"score"`.

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## process
## ---------------------------

## wide to long
df_long <- df %>%
    ## cols: current test columns
    ## names_to: where "math", "read", and "science" will go
    ## values_to: where the values in cols will go
    pivot_longer(cols = c("math","read","science"),
                 names_to = "test",
                 values_to = "score")

## show
df_long
```

> #### Quick (ocular test) exercise
> How many rows did our initial data frame `df` have? How many unique
> tests did we have in each year? When reshaping from wide to long,
> how many rows should we expect our new data frame to have? Does our
> new data frame have that many rows?

## Example: long --> wide

### `pivot_wider()`

Now that we have our long data, let's reshape it back to wide format
using `pivot_wider()`. In this case, we're doing just the opposite
from before --- here are the main arguments you need to attend to:

- `data`: the name of the data frame you're reshaping (we can use
  `%>%` to pipe in the data name)
- `names_from`: the name of the column that contains the values which
  will become new column names
- `values_from`: the name of the column that contains the values
  associated with the values in `names_from` column; these will go
  into the new columns.
  
```{r}
## ---------------------------
## process
## ---------------------------

## long to wide
df_wide <- df_long %>%
    ## names_from: values in this column will become new column names
    ## values_from: values in this column will become values in new cols
    pivot_wider(names_from = "test",
                values_from = "score")

## show
df_wide
```

> #### Quick exercise 
> In this case, our new wide data frame, `df_wide`, should be the same
> as our initial data frame. Is it? How can you tell?

## Example: wide --> long with corrections

Unfortunately, it's not always so clear cut to reshape data. In this
second example, we'll again reshape from wide to long, but we'll have
to munge our data a bit after the reshape to make it analysis ready.

First, we'll read in a second file `all_schools_wide.csv`. This file
contains the same information as before, but in a _very_ wide format:
each school has only one row and each test by year value gets its own
column in the form `<test>_<year>`.

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## input
## ---------------------------

## read in very wide test score data
df <- read_csv(file.path(sch_dir, "all_schools_wide.csv"))

## show
df
```

Second, we can `pivot_longer()` as we did before using the following
values for our key arguments:

- `data` : `df` (but piped in using `%>%`)
- `cols` : use special [tidyselect helper
  function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyselect/versions/1.0.0/topics/select_helpers)
  `contains()` to select all test by year columns
- `names_to`: `test_year`
- `values_to`: `score`

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## process
## ---------------------------

## wide to long
df_long <- df %>%
    ## NB: contains() looks for "19" in name: if there, it adds it to cols
    pivot_longer(cols = contains("19"),
                 names_to = "test_year",
                 values_to = "score")

## show
df_long
```

> #### Quick exercise 
> Why did we use "19" as our value in the contains() function?
> **HINT**: use the `names()` function to return a list of the
> original data frame (`df`) column names.

This mostly worked to get our data long, but now we have this weird
combined `test_year` column. What we really want are two columns, one
for the year and one for the test type. We can fix this using [tidyr
`separate()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html)
function with the following arguments:

- `data`: our `df_long` object, piped in using `%>%`
- `col`: the column we want to split (`test_year`)
- `into`: the names of the new columns to create from `col` (`test`
and `year`)
- `sep`: the name of the character that splits the values in `col`, so
  R knows how to fill each of the `into` columns (`"_"`)
  
```{r}
## separate test_year into two columns, filling appropriately
df_long_fix <- df_long %>%
    ## col: the column to split
    ## into: names of resulting splits
    ## sep: the split point --> left to "test", right to "year"
    separate(col = "test_year",
             into = c("test", "year"),
             sep = "_")

## show
df_long_fix
```

# Final note

Just as all data sets are unique, so too are the particular steps you
may need to take to **append**, **join**, or **reshape** your
data. Even experienced coders rarely get all the steps correct the
first try. Be prepared to spend time getting to know your data and
figuring out, through trial and error, how to wrangle it so that it
meets your analytic needs. Code books, institutional/domain knowledge,
and patience are your friends here!

```{r, include = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## end script
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
