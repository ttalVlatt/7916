In this lesson, we'll combine many of the pieces we've already
covered --- reading in data, cleaning data, making figures
--- into a single RMarkdown document. We'll purposefully keep it
simple at first by reusing some code we've seen before.

# Getting started

To properly compile a PDF documents from Markdown, you'll need some
version of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), a typesetting
system best known for being able to nicely render mathematical
notation but that is really useful for making reproducible
documents. You should have already downloaded this at the start of the
course. If you didn't, visit the [software
page](../software/index.html) for information on how to get it.

If you are unable to get LaTeX to install properly or cannot get the
document to compile as PDF, you should be able to compile to HTML
instead.

You will also need the R **knitr** and **rmarkdown** libraries. You should
have **rmarkdown** already, but if you haven't already installed either, type

```r
install.packages(c("knitr","rmarkdown"))
```

into your R console. **NOTE** that even if you've already installed
rmarkdown, `install.packages()` will just quickly reinstall it.

# What is RMarkdown?

[From the RStudio
website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html):

> R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An
> R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain
> text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code...

In other words, an RMarkdown (hereafter _RMD_) document has two basic
components:

- R code (in **code chunks**)
- Markdown text (most everything else outside of the code chunks)

RMD documents use the file ending, `*.Rmd`, which makes sense as they
combine `R` code with `md` text. To _compile_ an RMD file, meaning to

1. convert the plain Markdown text into formatted text
2. run R code, producing all output along the way
3. combine the Markdown text plus R output into a finished document

You will use the **rmarkdown** `render()` function, which in turn uses
the **knitr** `knit()` function under the hood. [It can be a bit
confusing how all the pieces work
together](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480), but luckily, you can
use RStudio's point-and-click interface to knit your documents. 

# Starting a new document

When you open a blank RMarkdown document, RStudio will by default fill
it with some example text that looks like this. You can change this in
RStudio's settings, but I think it's helpful to see the skeleton of an
RMarkdown document (plus, it's not a big deal to just erase the parts
you don't need).

### Example text in new file started via RStudio (default)

````
---
title: "Document Title"
author: "Benjamin Skinner"
date: "1/30/21"
output: pdf_document
---

`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`r ''````{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`r ''````{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  
````

Rather than going through this example text to learn about RMarkdown,
we'll use our own example document, `test_scores.Rmd`, which is linked
above. 

# Compile an RMarkdown document

We'll go through the main sections our example RMD document below. So
you can follow along better, you should compile `test_scores.Rmd` as
your first step.

Once you've downloaded the file and data (if you don't have it
already), place the RMD file in the `scripts` directory and the
unzipped data in the `data` directory.

When you open `test_scores.Rmd` in RStudio, you should see a button in
the upper left facet that says **Knit** with a ball of string icon.

![](/edh7916/assets/img/rstudio_rmarkdown.png)

If you have the working directory correctly set to
`scripts` and have placed the `sch_test/` data folder inside `data`,
you should be able to click **Knit** and have the document
compile into a PDF. By default, RStudio will open a PDF viewer window
or show you the file in the lower right facet in the **Viewer** tab.

**NOTE** that if you've had trouble with LaTeX, you should be
able to compile into an HTML file, which you can open in your browser.

# Sections of our document

## YAML header

YAML, which stands for ["YAML Ain't a Markup
Language"](https://yaml.org), is a common way to configure dynamic documents
like RMD documents. It's the first thing you see at the top of an
RMarkdown file. The YAML header is this piece of code:

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[2:7])
```

Notice the opening and closing three hyphens (`---`). This is how R
knows that this section of code is special. The YAML can become
complex, as you add document options, but for now we keep it simple:

- **title**: the document title (printed)
- **author**: the document author (printed)
- **date**: manually set date (printed)
  - leave **date** out of YAML and the date on which the document is
    compiled will be added automatically, or you can use the LaTeX
    macro `\today`, which will also print today's date
  - set **date** to `""` (empty string) for no printed date
- **output**: document output
  - `pdf_output`: for PDF (uses LaTeX)
  - `html_output`: for web page output (open in browser)
  - `word_output`: for MSWord output (uses MSWord)
  
We're using `pdf_output` but you can either change this setting or
override it when compiling the final document.

**NOTE** that the colon (`:`) is a special character in YAML. Notice that I
don't necessarily have to use quotation marks for strings with spaces ---
I do for the title, but not for my name. That said, if your title
includes a colon, you need to wrap the entire title string in double
quotation marks (`"`) --- otherwise the document won't compile.

## Code chunks

In general, an RMD code chunk looks like a markdown code chunk. The
key difference between the two is that while a plain markdown code
chunk is purely about formatting, the RMD code chunk will by default
try to run the code and print any output:

#### Markdown code chunk

````markdown
`r ''````r
## this is just a representation 
## when compiled: nothing happens, only code is printed
x <- rnorm(1000)
x
```
````

#### RMarkdown code chunk
	
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
## this is active R code
## when compiled: the R code is run, and both code and results are printed
x <- rnorm(1000)
x
```
````

See the difference? It's subtle, but notice that the RMD chunk
places braces around the **r** after the tick marks: `{r}`. In a
normal markdown document, the braces won't mean anything. But in an
RMD document, it's the difference between just printing the code and
running the code before printing the code and its output.

### Code chunk options

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[9:48])
```
   
In our first code chunk, notice how we still load our libraries and
set our file paths. For the libraries, we need to load knitr with
`library(knitr)` in addition to whichever libraries we need for our
analysis. As usual, we also load the tidyverse.

In addition to our normal analysis setup, notice that we add
knitr-specific options in two places.

#### Local code chunk options (only affect _this_ code chunk)

First, we can set _local code chunk options_ within the braces that
start the code chunk. These options will only affect this particular
code chunk.

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[9])
```

After `r`, the first word is the name of the chunk. I've called it
`setup`, since that's what this chunk is doing, but you can name it
anything you want. It's not strictly necessary to name your chunks,
but it can come in handy as your documents become more complex: if you
get an error, it's much easier to find `data_input` chunk than
`unnamed_chunk_38`. **NOTE** that all named chunks need to be unique
or your document will not compile. If really like a particular chunk
and want to reuse it, you can always add a number at the end:
`data_input_1`, `data_input_2`, `data_input_3`, _etc_.

There are a lot of [options you can
set](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) for your chunks. Here we set
the following:

- `echo=F` (FALSE): don't repeat this code in output
- `include=F` (FALSE): run code, but don't include output (unless a
  plot)
- `message=F` (FALSE): don't output any messages
- `warning=F` (FALSE): don't output any warnings
- `error=F` (FALSE): don't output any errors

As of [knitr 1.35](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/releases/tag/v1.35),
you can also include chunk options in rows below the opening line
using the `#|` symbol pair. We could rewrite our example options
using:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
#| echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, message = FALSE
#| warning = FALSE, error = FALSE

< ...chunk code... >
```
````

We could also use yaml syntax, which is nice for very long lines 
(we don't need that now, but it does come up sometimes).

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
#| echo: FALSE 
#| include: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| error: FALSE

< ...chunk code... >   
```
````

However you choose to include them, these options keep our chunk from
echoing the input code into our document and prevents any
output. Basically, silence. Sometimes we want our code to echo;
sometimes we want output. But since we are making a report, we
generally want the underlying code to remain hidden. Readers of our
report should only see the write up and any relevant tables and
figures --- but not all the hard coding we did to make them!


#### Global code chunk options (affect _all_ code chunks)

After this first chunk, we can save some typing by setting these
options for the rest of the document using
`knitr::opt_chunks$set()`. Notice that we include the same settings as
above plus a few more:

- `fig.path`: path + prefix for all figures (put them in our
  `/figures` folder and add `"ts-"` to the name)
- `dpi` (dots per inch): the print quality of our figures; 300 dpi is
  a nice standard for print (72dpi is sufficient for most web output)
- `out.width`: our figures should fill the line width; if it's an 8.5
  by 11 inch page with 1 inch margins, then a width of 7.5 inches
- `comment`: if we return code output, don't prepend with `#` or
  anything --- just the output.
  
[There are other options we can
use](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/). We can also override these
setting as necessary for individual code chunks using local settings
like we did in the first chunk (as you'll see below). The main idea
with the set up code chunk is to get our document settings as close as
possible to the way we generally want them.

### Chunk to chunk

Below, you see two code chunks with some Markdown text in the middle.

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[50:78])
```

An important thing to remember is that your coding environment carries
from chunk to chunk, meaning that if you read in data in the code
chunk (named `input`) as `df`, then `df` will still be available to
you in the next chunk (named `table_all`) after writing some Markdown
text. This means that you can still organize your RMD scripts like
your R scripts (no need to do everything at once in a single huge
chunk).

### Make a nice(r) table with `kable()`

Since we want to show all of our data (which isn't very big in this case) and
because the data frame `df` already is organized in the way we want to
show the data (school by year with different columns for each test),
we can just print out the data frame. To be clear, often our data will
be too big to do this, but in this instance, we are okay.

We could just print the data frame by calling `df` in a chunk. But to
make it look nicer with a better format, we use [`kable()` which is part of
knitr](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[69:78])
```
 
Even using mostly default options, `kable()` will make a nice looking
table for us. We add `digits = 0` to make sure that we only show whole
numbers and we change our column names to something nicer (leaving a
blank `""` for the school name column, which is obvious). Notice that
in the chunk braces we add `include = T` so that the output --- our
table --- for just this one code chunk will be printed. This is an
example of using local code chunk options to override global chunk
options. 

### Inline code

You can also call R code _inline_, that is, R code that sits outside of code chunks
proper and instead is mixed in with your Markdown text.

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[89:126])
```

Inside the code chunk called `table_averages` we do three things:

1. Use **dplyr** to munge our data to get averages
2. Store names and scores for high test scores in distinct well named
   objects:
   - `hi_<test>_sch`: school name with highest average math/read/science
     score
   - `hi_<test>_scr`: highest average math/read/science score
3. Make/print table using `kable()`

In the Markdown text below this code chunk, we call the values using
the inline code method 

````markdown
`r `
````

that is, single back tick, an `r`, the code we want, then closing back
tick. We also pipe the object value to the `round()` function so that
we don't return averages with extra and unnecessary decimal points. We
could have simply run all the code inline (included what we did in
step 2 of the code chunk above), but that would have made for extra
messy code.

Why do this? One reason is that being able to incorporate data-driven
values directly in your test is very powerful. Imagine you need to
reproduce the same report on a monthly or quarterly basis when data
are updated. Part of the written report includes values directly taken
or calculated from the data. Rather than update these ["magic
numbers"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))
each time (potentially missing some), you can use inline R code like
we've done here. All you need to do then is update the data and
recompile the report. Voila! Everything is properly updated.

Taking it a step further, you can include all kinds of `ifelse()` logic to make
complex dynamic documents. _If_ the value of _X_ is equal to or greater than the
value of _Y_, then print "equals or exceeds"; _else_ print "remains
less than". Be aware, however, that your document text
still needs to make sense. It can be difficult enough writing one
clear sentence; having to write a sentence that will remain coherent
despite variable inputs can be _very tough_!

### Figures

Finally, making figures is pretty much the same as making tables:

```{r, echo = F}
writeLines(readLines("../scripts/test_scores.Rmd")[129:158])
```

Having reshaped our original data frame long (`df_long`), we make a
figure just as we've done in the past --- with some formatting
improvements to make it nicer looking. While it's not strictly
necessary to store the figure in an object (`p`) that we then call, it
works just fine.

Notice that again added `include = T` to the chunk brace. Because we
added figure options to `opt_chunks$set()` in the setup code chunk,
this figure (as well as the next one) is sized so that it fills up the
page width (with height determined as a ratio of that width) and
printed at 300 dpi quality. If you look in the `figures` folder,
you'll see the figure named `ts-fig_unadjusted`, which is the prefix
we set above with the name of the code chunk.

## Text

Throughout our RMD file, we've include Markdown text. This text lives
outside of the code chunks and is always printed in the final
document. It follows normal Markdown text rules, but can have R code
placed inline, as we saw above.

# Writing an RMD document

Just as when you write a plain R script, your progress from initial
RMD draft to final product will be iterative. While you can run R code
from inside code chunks just as you've been all semester, you may find
it useful to start your analyses in plain R files first and only add
them to an RMD document later. 

For big projects, such as dissertation, it also doesn't make much
sense to put _everything_ --- data reading, cleaning, analysis,
table/figure making --- inside a single RMD document. You have to redo
your entire workflow each time you compile! For large projects, it
might make sense to do all the heavy lifting in separate R scripts ---
saving cleaned up data sets, tables, and figures along the way --- and
putting all the pre-establish pieces together at the end. But for
small projects, such a descriptive policy report, a single RMD
document might suffice.
