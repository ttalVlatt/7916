After your data have been wrangled from raw values to an analysis data
set and you've explored it with summary statistics and graphics, you
are ready to model it and begin making inferences. As one should
expect from a statistical language, R has a powerful system for
fitting statistical and econometric models.

Because the purpose of this course is to learn and practice using a
good quantitative work flow, we won't spend time much time
interpreting the results from our inferential models. Instead, this
lesson will give you the basic understanding you need to run
correlations and t-tests in R as well as give a quick overview of how
to use survey weights. (We'll cover regressions and predictions in a
later lesson.) That said, the lessons you've learned in other courses
about proper statistical practice still stand --- this lesson should
help you apply what you've learned before.

# Data

In this lesson, we'll use data from the [NCES Education Longitudinal
Study of 2002](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/). Much like HSLS,
ELS is a nationally representative survey that initially surveyed
students in their early high school career (10th grade in 2002) and
followed them into college and the workforce. We'll again use a
smaller version of the data, so be sure to get the full data files if
you decide to use ELS in a future project. One additional benefit of
ELS is that the public use files contain the weights we'll use to
properly account for the survey design later in the lesson. 

Here's a codebook with descriptions of the variables included in our
lesson today:

Let's load the libraries and data!

...but first! You'll most likely need to install the [`survey`
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survey) first, 
using `install.packages("survey")`. 

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## libraries
## ---------------------------

library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(survey)
```

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## directory paths
## ---------------------------

## assume we're running this script from the ./scripts subdirectory
dat_dir <- file.path("..", "data")
```

```{r, purl = TRUE, include = FALSE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Model data
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

```{r}
## ---------------------------
## input data
## ---------------------------

## assume we're running this script from the ./scripts subdirectory
df <- read_dta(file.path(dat_dir, "els_plans.dta"))
```

# Correlations
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## correlation
## ---------------------------
```
In prior lessons, we've visually checked for correlations between
variables through plotting. We can also produce more formal tests of
correlation using R's `cor()` function. By default, it gives us the
[Pearson correlation
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient),
though we can also use it to return other versions.

First, let's check the correlation between math and reading
scores. Because this is a base R function, we'll need to use `df$`
notation. We'll also need to be explicit about removing missing values
with the argument, `use = "complete.obs"` (one of the few annoying
function options that doesn't really match how other functions work).

```{r}
## correlation between math and reading scores
cor(df$bynels2m, df$bynels2r, use = "complete.obs")
```

As we might have hypothesized, there is a strong positive correlation
between math and reading scores.

We can also build a correlation matrix if we give `cor()` a data
frame. Our data set, though smaller than the full ELS data set, is
still rather large. We'll only check the correlations between a few
variables. In this next example, I'll show you how you might do this
using the tidyverse way we've used in other lessons.

```{r}
## correlation between various columns, using pipes
df %>%
    ## select a few variables
    select(byses1, bynels2m, bynels2r, par_ba) %>%
    ## use a . to be the placeholder for the piped in data.frame
    cor(., use = "complete.obs")
```

Per our expectations, the main diagonal is all 1s --- every variable
is perfectly correlated with itself --- and the mirror cells on either
side of the line are the same: [2,1] == [1,2] because the correlation
between `bynels2m` and `byses1` is the same as `byses1` and `bynels2m`
(the order doesn't matter).

# t-test
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## t-test
## ---------------------------
```

One common statistical test is a t-test for a difference in means
across groups (there are, of course, [other types of t-tests that R
can compute](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/t.test.html)). This
version of the test can be computed using the R formula syntax: `y ~
x`.  In our example, we'll compute base-year math scores against
parent's college education level. Notice that since we have the `data
= df` argument after the comma, we don't need to include `df$` before
the two variables.

```{r, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## t-test of difference in math scores across mother education (BA/BA or not)
ttest <- t.test(bynels2m ~ par_ba, data = df)
```

```{r}
## t-test of difference in math scores across parental education (BA/BA or not)
t.test(bynels2m ~ par_ba, data = df)
```

Looking at the bottom of the output, we see the mean math scores
across the two groups:

- Math score of ```r ttest$estimate[[1]]``` for students for whom
  neither parent has a Bachelor's degree or higher
- Math score of ```r ttest$estimate[[2]]``` for students for whom
  at least one parent has a Bachelor's degree or higher

Are these differences statistically meaningful? Looking in the third
line, we see a large t stat of ```r round(ttest$statistic, 2)``` which
is highly statistically significant at conventional levels. Taken
together, we can say that among this sample of students, those from
households in which at least one parent had a Bachelor's degree or
higher tended to score higher on the math exam than their peers whose
parents did not have a Bachelor's degree or higher. Furthermore, this
result is _statistically significant_, meaning that we can reject the
null that there is no difference between the groups, that is, the
difference we observe is just sampling noise. 

Is the difference _practically significant_? Maybe, but to really know
that we need to understand more about the design and scaling of the
math test. Once we do, we can apply our content-area knowledge and
place our findings in their proper context.

# Using survey weights
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## survey weights
## ---------------------------
```

So far we haven't used survey weights, but they are very important if
we want to make population-level inferences using surveys with complex
sampling designs. Yes, we can produce means, compute t-tests, and fit
regressions without weights, but our results may not be externally
valid due the fact that observations in our sample are almost
certainly out of proportion to their occurrence in the
population. Otherwise stated, it's likely that our sample
under-represents some groups while over-representing others. The
upshot is that any unweighted estimates will be a function of what we
observe (sample) and not necessarily what we want
(population). Furthermore, our standard errors --- which we use when
determining statistical significance --- may be incorrect if we don't
use survey weights, meaning that we may be more likely to commit Type
I or Type II errors.

So that we can make population-level inferences, survey designers
often include weights that allow us to adjust the amount each
observation contributes to our estimates. With this adjustment our
estimate should better reflect the population value.  To use survey
weights, you'll need to use the survey package (which we've already
loaded above).

As a first step, you need to set the survey design using the
`svydesign()` function. You could do this in the `svymean()` or
`svyglm()` functions we'll use to actually produce our weighted
estimates, but it's easier and clearer to do it first, store it in an
object, and then re-use that object.

[ELS has a complex sampling design that we won't get
into](https://nces.ed.gov/training/datauser/ELS_04.html), but the
appropriate columns from our data frame, `df`, are set to the proper
arguments in `svydesign()`:

* `ids` are the primary sampling units or `psu`s  
* `strata` are indicated by the `strat_id`s  
* `weight` is the base-year student weight or `bystuwt`
* `data` is our data frame object, `df`
* `nest = TRUE` because the `psu`s are nested in `strat_id`s

Finally, notice the `~` before each column name, which is necessary in
this function.

```{r}
## subset data
svy_df <- df %>%
    select(psu,                         # primary sampling unit
           strat_id,                    # stratum ID
           bystuwt,                     # weight we want to use
           bynels2m,                    # variables we want...
           moth_ba,
           fath_ba,
           par_ba,
           byses1,
           lowinc,
           female) %>%
    ## go ahead and drop observations with missing values
    drop_na()

## set svy design data
svy_df <- svydesign(ids = ~psu,
                    strata = ~strat_id,
                    weight = ~bystuwt,
                    data = svy_df,
                    nest = TRUE)
```

Now that we've set the survey design, let's compare the unweighted
mean with one that accounts for the survey design.

```{r}
## compare unweighted and survey-weighted mean of math scores
df %>% summarise(bynels2m_m = mean(bynels2m, na.rm = TRUE))
svymean(~bynels2m, design = svy_df, na.rm = TRUE)
```

It's a little different!

We can also use the survey package to properly weight our t-tests and
regression models --- again, using the object `svy_df` in
the `design` argument in place of our unset `df` data frame.

```{r}
## get svymeans by group
svyby(~bynels2m, by = ~par_ba, design = svy_df, FUN = svymean, na.rm = TRUE)

## t-test using survey design / weights
svyttest(bynels2m ~ par_ba, design = svy_df)
```

Notice that unlike the base R `t.test()` function, `svyttest()` gives
the difference between the groups. That's part of the reason we began
by using `svyby()` function with `FUN = svymean`. Looking at the full
output between the two functions, our results are a little different
from what we got earlier without weights.

> #### QUICK EXERCISE
> Compare this to the output from `t.test()` above. How is it
> different? 

Two notes:

First, the **survey** library has a ton of features and is worth diving
into if you regularly work with survey data. We've only scratched the
surface of what it can do. But keep in mind that whatever statistical
test you want to perform, there's likely a version that works with
survey weights via this library.

Second, you'll have to spend **a lot** of time reading the survey
methodology documents in order to understand which weights you should
you use (context always matters) so that you can properly set up your
survey design with `svydesign()`. But be warned: even then it won't
always be clear which weights are the "correct" weights. That said, do
as you always do: (1) your due diligence, and (2) be prepared to
defend your choice as well as note potential limitations.
