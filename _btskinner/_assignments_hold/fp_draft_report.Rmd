From the syllabus:

> For your final project, you must produce a 3-5 page report on a higher
> education topic of interest. The report should be a combination of
> writing, tables, and figures, have minimal citations (if any), and be
> fully reproducible with minimal effort. You must use data that is
> either publicly available or that can be shared with others (no IRB
> restrictions). Everyone will submit three preliminary assignments in
> addition to the final report.

**This assignment represents the third of those three preliminary
assignments.**

For your draft report, I need the following in a cleanly formatted
RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file:

1. Well commented code that:
   - Reads in your raw data set
   - Performs all necessary data wrangling tasks to clean, join, and
     reshape your data as necessary for your project
   - Performs all necessary analyses
1. Plots (as necessary, but required) to show the results of your analyses
1. Tables (as necessary, but not required) to show the results of your
   analyses
1. First draft of the written elements of your report; these elements
   should:
   - Motivate your analyses
   - Describe your data
   - Describe your methodological approach, in high-level,
     audience-appropriate manner (think your boss or colleagues, not
     me specifically)
   - Describe your findings
   - Appropriately contextualize your results (_e.g._ limitations,
     validity) and make appropriate recommendations
   - **[If necessary]** Include citations
   - Be well organized

_Please also submit your raw data files so that I can run your
script. If your files are very large (too large to upload to CANVAS,
contact me so that we can figure out another way for you to get your
data to me._

#### Submission details

- Upload to our CANVAS course site no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on the
  due date 
- Save your file as: `<name>_draft_report.Rmd` (if submitting an Rmd
  file) where your last name replaces `<name>` (_e.g._
  `skinner_draft_report.Rmd`).
- Submit data files (zipped if necessary)
