_**NOTE** This assignment needs to be completed by the start of the
next class. That means everything pushed to your remote GitHub repo
before class starts. If you are unsure whether you have successfully
pushed your changes, check the online version of your repo at
GitHub.com. If you can see your changes there, I can see them too._

_Remember, I encourage you to save your work,
commit smaller changes, and push to your remote GitHub repo often
rather than wait until the last minute._

Your final project will be to produce a 3-5 page reproducible report
on an education topic of your choosing. It should: 

- contain a combination of writing, tables, and figures
- have minimal citations 
- be fully reproducible with minimal effort

The sophistication of your analyses should be commensurate with your
statistical training so far. That said, I'm generally expecting
descriptive analyses targeted at sophisticated, but non-technical
audiences. By far the most important aspects of the report are that
your underlying code follows the good practices we learn over the
semester and that **the final report is reproducible (by me) with
minimal effort**.

To facilitate the last item it is a requirement that **everyone must
use publicly available data.** For purposes of this project, a publicly
available data set is one that anyone can, today, download from a
website. This restriction, therefore, excludes data you've received
from your advisor, that you've collected yourself, or that one could
theoretically get by emailing an administrator or author of a paper.

To help you get started, your assignment this week is to 

1. brainstorm a topic of interest
1. find a publicly-available data set that will allow you examine that
   topic in a short descriptive analysis
1. begin reading through the technical report and codebook to see
   which variables you might use

I would recommend using of the [NCES panel data
sets](https://nces.ed.gov/OnlineCodebook) or
[IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/login.aspx), but I'm open
to others.

Create a new folder called `final_project` in your student
repo. Submit a Markdown file called
`final_project_dataset_<last_name>.md` with the following information:


- Name and link to data set you plan to use
- 1-2 paragraph(s) on your topic idea, with at least a sentence or two
  about how the data set you've chosen will help you examine your topic
- A [Markdown
  table](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables) with
  5-10 key variables and their descriptions that you plan to use to
  examine your topic
